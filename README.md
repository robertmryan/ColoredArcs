This is an demonstration of updating `CAShapeLayer` as gesture changes in Objective-C.

Note, I also used `IB_DESIGNABLE` view so that you can render (and customize the appearance) in Interface Builder storyboard. You don't have to do this, but it makes designing of user interfaces a little easier.

See [https://stackoverflow.com/a/48407910/1271826](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48407910/1271826).

This was developed in Objective-C on Xcode 9.2 for iOS 11.2. But, the basic ideas are equally applicable for different versions of Objective-C and iOS versions.
